# Data Structures & Algorithms — Notes

A curated set of readable, well-organized notes and reference implementations for common data structures and algorithms in C++. These notes are intended for students, interview preparation, self-study, and developers who want clear explanations with practical code examples.

## Purpose

This repository collects concise, example-driven notes to help you understand and apply core data structures and algorithms. Each topic combines a conceptual explanation, complexity analysis, common pitfalls, and an idiomatic C++ implementation you can study or reuse.

Use cases:
- Learning or teaching core CS topics
- Interview preparation (quick refresh and code templates)
- Reference when implementing algorithms in projects
- Foundation for building competitive programming utilities

---

## What's included

- Explanations and implementations for:
  - Arrays, Vectors
  - Linked Lists (singly, doubly, circular)
  - Stacks & Queues
  - Hash tables / unordered maps
  - Trees (binary, BST, AVL, segment tree, trie)
  - Heaps / priority queues
  - Graphs (representations, traversals, shortest paths)
  - Sorting algorithms (quick, merge, heap, counting, etc.)
  - Searching algorithms (binary search variants)
  - Dynamic programming patterns and examples
- Complexity analysis (time/space) and common trade-offs
- Example problems and suggested practice exercises

## Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/0xSubhan/Data_Structures_and_Algorithms_Notes.git
2. Browse the notes/markdown files for theory and src/ for code examples.
3. Build/run example C++ files using your preferred compiler, e.g.:
   g++ -std=c++17 src/example.cpp -O2 -o example && ./example

## How to use these notes

- Read the conceptual section first to understand the purpose and invariants.  
- Review the complexity analysis to understand when to use the structure/algorithm.  
- Study the provided implementation and run the example programs.  
- Modify the code to experiment with edge cases and performance.  
- Use the practice problems to cement understanding.
