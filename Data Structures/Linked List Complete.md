#  **What is an Abstract Data Type (ADT)?**

>An **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** is a **concept** — not a concrete implementation.  
It defines **what** operations can be performed on some data, but **not how** those operations are implemented.

#### 🧠 In simple terms:

Think of ADT as a **blueprint** or **contract** for a data structure.

It says:

> “You can do these operations and expect these results…”

But it doesn’t say:

> “…and here’s how those operations are actually done inside.”

#### ⚙️ Example:

Let’s take the **Stack** as an example of an ADT.

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|`push(x)`|Add element `x` on top of the stack|
|`pop()`|Remove and return the top element|
|`peek()`|Return (but don’t remove) the top element|
|`isEmpty()`|Check if the stack has no elements|

The ADT tells us **these are the valid operations**, but not **how** they’re implemented.

#### 🧩 Implementations:

The **implementation** can vary:

- Using an **array**
    
- Using a **linked list**
    

Both satisfy the “Stack ADT” — because both allow push, pop, peek, etc. —  
but the internal working (how data is stored, accessed) is different.

#### 💡 Real-life analogy:

Think of a **TV remote**:

- You know what buttons do — volume up, power off, channel change.
    
- You don’t know (and don’t need to know) how the circuit inside performs it.
    

That’s exactly how **ADT** hides details → it provides **abstraction**.

#### 🧾 Common ADTs:

Here are some widely used abstract data types:
🧩 In short:

ADT = Logical view (what it does)
Data Structure = Physical view (how it’s done)

|ADT|Description|
|---|---|
|**List**|Ordered collection of elements|
|**Stack**|LIFO (Last In First Out) structure|
|**Queue**|FIFO (First In First Out) structure|
|**Deque**|Double-ended queue|
|**Set**|Collection of unique elements|
|**Map (Dictionary)**|Collection of key–value pairs|
#### 🔑 Key Points:

- ADT focuses on **what** operations are performed, not **how**.
    
- It provides **abstraction** and **data encapsulation**.
    
- Actual implementation is called a **data structure**.

#### 🧩 In short:

> **ADT = Logical view (what it does)**  
> **Data Structure = Physical view (how it’s done)**

### List as a abstract data type

A **List ADT** represents an **ordered collection of elements**,  
where each element has a specific **position (index)**,  
and **duplicates are allowed**.

It defines **what operations** can be performed on a list —  
but not **how** those operations are implemented internally.

#### ⚙️ The Concept

When we say **List ADT**, we mean:

> “A collection where you can access elements by position, insert or remove them, and the order matters.”

For example:  
`[10, 20, 30, 40]`  
This is a list with elements in a defined order.

#### 🧱 List ADT — Typical Operations

|Operation|Description|
|---|---|
|`insert(pos, x)`|Insert element `x` at position `pos`|
|`remove(pos)`|Remove the element at position `pos`|
|`get(pos)`|Return the element at position `pos`|
|`set(pos, x)`|Replace element at position `pos` with `x`|
|`size()`|Return the number of elements in the list|
|`isEmpty()`|Check if the list is empty|
|`clear()`|Remove all elements from the list|

These are **logical operations** — they describe **what** can be done.

#### 🧩 Implementations (Data Structures)

The **List ADT** can be implemented in different ways:

|Implementation|Description|Example in C++|
|---|---|---|
|**Array-based list**|Uses a fixed or dynamic array internally|`std::vector`|
|**Linked list**|Uses nodes connected by pointers|`std::list`|
|**Doubly linked list**|Each node has pointers to both next and previous|`std::list` again or custom|

All of these satisfy the **List ADT**,  
but the performance of operations differs depending on the implementation.

#### ✅ In short:

> **List ADT defines what operations are possible on an ordered collection of elements,  
> not how they are performed.**

###  **“Data structure is not just the study of organizing data in a certain manner; it is also the study of how costly or efficient operations of an ADT are.”**

#### 🧩 Step 1: What this means

When we learn **data structures**, we’re not only learning **how** to store data —  
we’re also learning **how well** different storage methods perform when used with an **ADT**.

So, data structures =  
➡️ **organization of data** +  
➡️ **analysis of operation efficiency**.

#### 🧠 Step 2: Connection between ADT and Data Structure

- **Abstract Data Type (ADT)** defines **what** operations exist (the “interface”).  
    Example: For a List ADT — insert, remove, get, size.
    
- **Data Structure** defines **how** those operations are implemented (the “implementation”).
    

Now, different data structures can implement the same ADT **with different efficiencies**.

#### ⚙️ Step 3: Example — List ADT

Suppose we want to implement the **List ADT**.

We have two options:

1. **Array-based list**
    
2. **Linked list**
    

Both can perform operations like insert, remove, and access.  
But the **cost** (time or memory) of these operations differs:

|Operation|Array-based List|Linked List|
|---|---|---|
|Access element by index|O(1)|O(n)|
|Insert at beginning|O(n)|O(1)|
|Insert at end|O(1) (amortized)|O(1)|
|Remove middle element|O(n)|O(n)|

So even though both satisfy the same **ADT**,  
their **efficiency (cost)** of performing operations is very different.

#### ⚖️ Step 4: Why this matters

When choosing a data structure, you must consider:

- How **frequently** each operation is performed
    
- Which operations need to be **fast**
    
- The **space** (memory) usage
    

For example:

- If you often need **random access**, use **array** (O(1)).
    
- If you often **insert/delete** at the start, use **linked list** (O(1)).

#### 🧾 Step 5: The takeaway

> Learning data structures means understanding **trade-offs** —  
> how each structure affects the **performance** of ADT operations.

It’s not enough to just know _how_ to store data;  
you must also know _how efficiently_ your structure supports the operations you need.

#### ✅ Summary

|Concept|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**ADT**|Defines _what_ operations exist|
|**Data Structure**|Defines _how_ those operations are implemented|
|**Efficiency Study**|Measures how _costly_ those operations are (in time and space)|
|**Goal**|Choose the best structure for your problem|
